# badminton-score
A simple and fast scoreboard for badminton games and tournaments

Although Badminton was the inspiration, this scoreboard could be used in other sports, with few modifications.
The main goal is to be used with a Raspberry Pi and TV, so it could be used in places without an eletronic scoreboard.
